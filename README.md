 Linux File Permissions Project

This project demonstrates how to manage file permissions in a Linux environment using Python. It creates a text file, displays its permissions 
in Unix format (e.g., -rwxr--r--`), and modifies them using the `chmod command from within the script. A visual flowchart is also included to illustrate 
the process step-by-step. The project aims to bridge the gap between system administration 
and programming in a simple and educational way.
